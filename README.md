# Speech-to-Text Android App

## Features  

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Displays words as you speak (live transcription).  
- **Final Recognized Text**: Replaces partial text once speech ends.  
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages when recognition fails.  
- **Retry Mechanism**: If an error occurs, the button switches to **"Try Again"**.  
- **Microphone Permissions**: Requests runtime permissions for smooth operation.
